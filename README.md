## Contributing
The project runs with a Rust backend and React frontend (TS), with Tauri connecting the two.

Dependencies
- Rust
- Node.js (^18)
- Yarn
- [Tauri's prequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/)

What we'd like the community to focus on is implementing plugins that allow a user to add specific actions to their macro sequences. E.g. Controlling smart lights brightness, colour, etc.

This entails adding to both the backend and frontend. In the backend, you would add the logic required for the actions to work. In the frontend, you would simply update the necessary UI and maps that would render for a user.

You can always open an issue if you encounter any problems. Looking to add something you created? If it's a small change (i.e. text change or bug fix) feel free to open a PR anytime. If you want to add a feature, please open an issue to discuss with the community first.

### Devving
